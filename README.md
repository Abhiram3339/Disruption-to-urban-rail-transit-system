# Disruption-to-urban-rail-transit-system
 Developed a system to predict the impact of disruptions on urban rail transit networks,
 using algorithms like decision trees and gradient boosting. Overcame data scarcity through domain projection
 and feature-space alignment, improving model accuracy and generalization. Real-world commuter behavior and
 travel delays were analyzed to provide data-driven insights, improve system resilience, and optimize emergency
 response strategies.
